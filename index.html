        <p>Hello World! Firstly, to introduce myself, I am Joyson P, an aspiring developer trying to make my mark in the digital world. I have always been interested in computers and their functionalities behind the scenes. However, life took me on a different path, where I ended up in the aviation industry after college. But I always heard the call of the digital world in the depths of my heart. When I am not navigating through the intricate world of binary data, I find myself playing music and diving into books. I am a big sucker for knowledge and find myself learning for fun; I am sure everyone does. I currently have a blog on Facebook, "Lover of my Soul," which I have been working on in the past few years. Overall, I am seeking to empower children and women through my coding. I am focused on these two demographics because many children are being exploited worldwide due to their lack of education access. I am very close to my mother and have seen the impact she has on my life; therefore, I have always sought women's empowerment. I genuinely believe that in a world where we respect and celebrate the women in our life, we will be that much closer to achieving "World Peace." I seek to connect myself with like-minded people worldwide; because all of humanity must join in unison to achieve this goal. If people learn their value, they will love one another, and education plays a crucial role in knowing one's identity and worth. The goal is to make education a right and not a privilege, to every soul born into this world, starting with one code at a time.</p>  
        <br>
          <p>I'm hoping to connect with you all; please feel free to contact me.             
           </p>
