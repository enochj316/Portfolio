Responsive Portfolio is a project to create a responsive website using bootstrap, which will adapt to different screen sizes. Using Visual Studio Code as the editor, this website was crafted using HTML 5 semantics, making it accessible to all viewers. 

I found this to be a very engaging assignment, which made me utilize the CSS skills I learned in "Boot Camp."
